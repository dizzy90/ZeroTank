# ZeroTank
Fork of the [ZeroBot](https://github.com/CoretechR/ZeroBot) project with some minor fixes and changes to fit my tank project.

## Install script
Installs all the dependencies for the script to be able to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W.
Example: `$ sudo ./tank_install.sh`
*Note:* `tank_install.sh` assumes that the project directory is `/home/<NAME>/ZeroTank`. You may want to modify this if the project is not located there.
